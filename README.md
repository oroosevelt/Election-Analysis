## Election Audit Summary

With a large sum of information during the elections, it is crucial to calculate all the votes accurate;y and within a short window of time to produce the results. The script can help and retrieve all the data with ease and display all the information needed to determine a winner. Addition to finding the results, the script also determined how many voters from each county casted their votes as well as which county had the largest turnout. 

Without having to make many modifications, if the auditors can provide the information as they already have done, reusing the script for future elections can continue to be a resourceful tool.
